    <h2>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b>(born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai;
      <i>25 December 1876 â€“ 11 September 1948</i>) was a barrister, politician
      and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India
      Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of
      <b>Pakistan on 14 August 1947</b>, and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's
      first governor-general until his death. He is revered in Pakistan as the
      Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader") and <i><b>Baba-e-Qaum</b></i> ("Father of
      the Nation"). His birthday is observed as a national holiday in Pakistan.

    <h2>Struggle for Pakistan</h2>
    <p>
      Until the late 1930s, most Muslims of the <b>British Raj</b> expected,
      upon independence, to be part of a unitary state encompassing all of
      British India, as did the Hindus and others who advocated self-government.
      Despite this, other nationalist proposals were being made. In a speech
      given at Allahabad to a League session in 1930, Sir Muhammad Iqbal called
      for a state for Muslims in British India. Choudhary Rahmat Ali published a
      pamphlet in 1933 advocating a state "Pakistan" in the Indus Valley, with
      other names given to <b><i>Muslim-majority</i></b> areas elsewhere in
      India. Jinnah and Iqbal corresponded in <i>1936 and 1937</i>; in
      subsequent years, Jinnah credited <b>Iqbal</b> as his mentor, and used
      Iqbal's imagery and rhetoric in his speeches.
