    <h1>HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>HyperText Markup Language or HTML</b> is the standard markup
      language for documents designed to be displayed in a <i>web browser</i>.
      It is often assisted by technologies such as
      <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b>
      and <i>scripting languages</i> such as <b>JavaScript</b>.
    </p>

      In 1980, <b>physicist Tim Berners-Lee</b>, a contractor at <b>CERN</b>,
      proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and
      share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an
      <i> Internet-based hypertext system</i>. Berners-Lee specified HTML and
      wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee
      and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint
      request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In
      his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in
      which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.
