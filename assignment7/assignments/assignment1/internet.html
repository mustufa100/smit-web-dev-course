    <h1>Internet</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>Internet (or internet)</b> is the global system of interconnected
      computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite <i>(TCP/IP)</i> to
      communicate between networks and devices. The Internet is the single
      largest network of networks (or "internet") that consists of private,
      public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global
      scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical
      networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information
      resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and
      applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and
      file sharing.

      The word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning
      <b>interconnected or interwoven</b>. The word Internet was used in 1945 by
      the <i>United States War Department</i> in a radio operator's manual, and
      1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork. Today, the term Internet most
      commonly refers to the global system of interconnected computer networks,
      though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks.
